### Manual Gradient Descent Implementation
I implemented and explained the first iteration of gradient descent using gradient descent formulas, computing predictions, and MSE step-by-step.

### Visualization
I created clear Matplotlib plots to show how the slope (m), intercept (b), and error (MSE) changed over iterations.

### Optimization Using SciPy
I used SciPyâ€™s minimize() function with BFGS method and a custom callback to track and print updates during optimization.

### Debugging and Explanation
I analyzed the differences between manual and SciPy-based approaches and explained key mathematical concepts like gradient signs and the role of x in updates.
